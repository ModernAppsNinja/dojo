## About the ModernApps Ninja Community

The ModernApps Ninja Community originally started to host lab guides for the VMware internal PKS Ninjs SME program for select VMware SE's. The original PKS-Ninja program assets are still online and available for reference at [https://github.com/cna-tech/pks-ninja](https://github.com/cna-tech/pks-ninja)

Practical, hands on experience and regular practice is key to becoming an effective practitioner in cloud native technologies. The Ninja learning model focuses on hands on eductation, centered around real world workflows, tools and processes, and made real through actual contribution in open & open source community projects

While the community does have an overall focus on VMware products, all are welcome as learning materials on this site cross a broad range of related topics with a strong focus on open source, devops, and all things cloud native.

Thanks for your interest in the ModernApps Ninja Community!
